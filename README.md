# RushHourSolver
A program written in C which bruteforces the best solution for [the popular boardgame/onlinegame Rushhour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)). 
This is the implementation of the C program in an Android App.

For the C file navigate to [this link](https://github.com/HalvarKelm/RushHourSolver/blob/master/app/src/main/cpp/rushhour.c).
I know it performs poorly in memory usage and speed but it was one of my first larger C projects and was great for practicing and keeping track of pointers and structs.
I am open to all kinds of feedback and suggestions and will probably rework and clarify the whole thing since it was a really fun problem to solve!
